# LingOS: A Minimal Embedded Operating System

## Project Introduction

LingOS is a meticulously crafted minimal embedded operating system designed for resource-constrained environments. It focuses on providing a lean, efficient, and robust foundation for embedded applications, prioritizing performance and a small footprint. This project aims to offer a clear and understandable codebase for learning and developing custom embedded solutions.

## Key Features

*   **Minimal Footprint**: Optimized for low memory and storage usage.
*   **Essential System Services**: Provides core functionalities required for basic embedded operations.
*   **Modular Design**: Structured for easy extension and customization.
*   **BusyBox Integration**: Includes a lightweight set of Unix utilities for a functional command-line environment.
*   **Kernel Development Focus**: Emphasizes a clear separation between kernel and user-space components.

```

## Building LingOS

To build LingOS, you'll need a suitable development environment. The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts to automate the build process.

1.  **Set up the environment (Optional, but recommended for consistency)**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/set-env.sh
    ```

2.  **Build BusyBox**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build-busybox.sh
    ```

3.  **Build the Linux Kernel**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build-kernel.sh
    ```

4.  **Build the Initramfs**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build-initramfs.sh
    ```

5.  **Perform a full system build** (this will orchestrate the above steps if not done individually):

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build-sys.sh
    ```

## Running LingOS

After successfully building LingOS, you can run it using QEMU, a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer.

```bash
./scripts/qemu-run.sh
```

This script will launch QEMU and boot the LingOS image, allowing you to interact with the minimal embedded environment.
